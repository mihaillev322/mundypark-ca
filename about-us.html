<h1>About this Mundy Park visitor guide for Canada</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our purpose: clear planning for outdoor recreation</h2>
<p>This Mundy Park visitor guide exists to help visitors plan safe, enjoyable, and respectful visits to Mundy Park in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia. Whether you are a local resident exploring your neighborhood or a visitor traveling from elsewhere in Canada, our goal is to provide practical, accurate, and accessible information about Mundy Park hiking, trails, amenities, and family park activities.</p>
<p>We recognize that outdoor recreation planning involves many questions: Which trails are suitable for my fitness level? What facilities are available? When is the best time to visit? How do I prepare for changing weather? This guide addresses these questions with clear, supportive language and a focus on helping you make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Our approach is educational and supportive, avoiding hype or exaggeration. We aim to set realistic expectations, highlight both opportunities and considerations, and encourage responsible outdoor behavior. By providing context, practical advice, and links to authoritative sources, we empower visitors to plan confidently and enjoy Mundy Park's natural and recreational offerings.</p>
<p>This guide is not affiliated with any government agency, commercial entity, or advocacy organization. It is an independent resource designed to complement official information from the City of Port Coquitlam and other authoritative sources. We encourage readers to verify current conditions, hours, and regulations through official channels before their visit.</p>
</section>

<section id="editorial-standards">
<h2>Editorial standards and how we avoid guesswork</h2>
<p>Accuracy and reliability are central to this guide's value. We follow a clear sourcing hierarchy to ensure that the information we provide is trustworthy and verifiable. Our primary sources are municipal and provincial government websites, including the City of Port Coquitlam and BC Parks, which offer authoritative information about park facilities, regulations, and conditions.</p>
<p>When official sources do not provide sufficient detail, we consult reputable organizations, news outlets, and educational institutions. For general context—such as background on Port Coquitlam or outdoor recreation principles—we may reference Wikipedia and other widely recognized reference works, always with appropriate attribution and links.</p>
<p>We avoid speculation and do not invent details about trail distances, facility hours, or event schedules when precise information is unavailable. Instead, we provide decision frameworks and encourage readers to confirm specifics through official channels. This approach respects the dynamic nature of park conditions and ensures that our guidance remains useful even as details change.</p>
<p>Our editorial tone is educational and supportive, designed to inform without overwhelming. We use plain language, short sentences, and clear structure to make information accessible to a wide audience, including those who may be new to outdoor recreation or unfamiliar with the area.</p>
<p>We review and update content periodically to reflect changes in park facilities, access, and best practices. However, readers should always verify current conditions, especially regarding closures, weather, and special events, by consulting the City of Port Coquitlam or other official sources before their visit.</p>

<section id="accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility and inclusive language</h2>
<p>We are committed to making this guide accessible to all visitors, regardless of ability, experience level, or familiarity with outdoor recreation. Our accessibility efforts include the use of plain language, readable typography, semantic HTML structure, and keyboard-navigable design.</p>
<p>Plain language means avoiding jargon, using short sentences, and explaining concepts clearly. We aim for a reading level that is accessible to a broad audience, including those for whom English is a second language or who may have cognitive or learning differences.</p>
<p>Our website design prioritizes readability and usability. We use sufficient color contrast, clear heading hierarchy, and descriptive link text to support screen readers and other assistive technologies. Keyboard navigation is fully supported, and we avoid design patterns that rely solely on mouse or touch interaction.</p>
<p>We also support users who prefer reduced motion by disabling animations and transitions when the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> setting is enabled in their browser or operating system. This ensures that our site is comfortable and usable for visitors with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity.</p>
<p>Inclusive language is important to us. We use person-first language when discussing accessibility and avoid assumptions about visitors' abilities, backgrounds, or motivations. Our goal is to provide information that respects and serves the full diversity of Mundy Park's visitors.</p>
<p>For detailed accessibility guidance and standards, we refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">W3C WAI accessibility fundamentals</a>, which inform our design and content decisions.</p>
