<summary>When is the best time to visit Mundy Park?</summary>
<div>
<p>Spring through fall offers ideal weather for outdoor activities, though the park is accessible year-round for various seasonal recreation opportunities.</p>

Always check weather forecasts and trail conditions before visiting, and be prepared to adjust your plans based on current conditions.</p>
<p>Weekday mornings and late afternoons tend to be less crowded than weekends and midday periods, providing a more tranquil experience for those seeking solitude or quieter observation opportunities.</p>
